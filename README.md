# Minecraft-TouchBar
This is a proof-of-concept of a use of the MacBook Pro's TouchBar.
It relies on the Forge Modding API, and on JTouchBar (https://github.com/Thizzer/jtouchbar).
By default, it shows the health, the coordinates and the amount of arrows in the player inventory.
As it relies on JTouchBar, you can modify the TouchBar as you want during the game.
